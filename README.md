## About
Hello! I am a disabled adult who loves art. My mission is to bring my art to others in a way that inspires them to become their own artist. Each product on my page is for sale as a kit, so that in their hands, they can bring that art to life, even if they have never painted before or felt they couldn't because of a disability or lack of skill.

I decided to pick up art to help with my own disability, and it has become a new way of life for me. I have a Bachelor's degree in Art because I wanted to expand my own knowledge and learn new ways to create art, from sketches to oil paintings, sculptures, and even blankets. The positive impact art has had on my life is something I want others to experience. I want everyone to feel the freedom and love that creating art brings.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope my art kits inspire you to create something beautiful!
